# Scrypta dApp Composer

This middleware API is built with NestJS and can be used to create a middleware service for any kind of backend.

This middleware communicates directly with one of the available IdaNodes to send and receive informations without calling them.

You can use it to create specific and structured calls and write your own rules before send the data to the blockchain.

Please refer to the official documentation for more informations: https://scrypta.wiki
